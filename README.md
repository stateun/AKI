# Acute Kidney Injury Prediction Model Repository

This repository contains the code developed during the preliminary and final rounds of the **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) Data Science Competition**, organized by Seoul National University Bundang Hospital.

## Competition Theme
The competition aimed to develop AI models that can be practically utilized in real-world clinical settings using datasets of AKI patients. 

### Competition Overview
1. **Preliminary Round**:  
   Participants developed AKI prediction models using the publicly available **MIMIC-IV dataset**.  

2. **Final Round**:  
   Qualified teams advanced to create and refine models with real-world data from **Seoul National University Bundang Hospital**.
